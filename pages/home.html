	<h1>Motivation</h1>
		<p>
			The ‘Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction’ is a Kaggle competition to predict the revenue generated per 
			customer from data of the Google Merchandise Store (GStore). The data presents us with a skewed target variable, 
			where only a small number of customer visits generate non-zero revenue. Some customers may also visit the GStore 
			multiple times, which produces sequential data. State of the art algorithms such as linear regression and 
			regression trees are insufficient for predicting skewed and sequential data. As such, we propose a joint 
			classification-regression technique, which is more robust against skewed data. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) will
			be integrated into the proposed system to handle sequential data. Business owners will obviously find this joint 
			model useful to analyze customer generated revenue. Furthermore, this model can be generalized to be used for any 
			sequential data with skewed target variable.

	<h1>Problem Statement and Challenge</h1>
	<p>
		We would like to implement machine learning systems that accurately predicts customer generated revenue. The dataset being 
		used is very skewed. The dataset also contains recursive data instances.
	</p>
	<h1>Evaluation</h1>
	<p>
		Performance of our proposed methods will be compared to the state-of-the-art methods using Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) 
		which is defined as:
